## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Viteâš¡ React.js with TypeScript

- **Routing**: React Router DOM

> ### Why React.js instead of Next.js
We chose React.js over Next.js for this application for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: The application is focused on client-side functionality with minimal server-side requirements, making React's client-side rendering approach sufficient.
2. **Learning Curve**: Using plain React.js allows for easier onboarding of new developers without the additional complexity of Next.js features.
3. **Deployment Flexibility**: The application can be deployed as a static site, allowing for simpler hosting options.
4. **Single-Page Application**: As a dashboard-focused customer portal, the SPA model works well without the need for Next.js's server-side rendering optimizations.
